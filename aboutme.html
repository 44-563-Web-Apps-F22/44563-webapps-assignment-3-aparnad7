            I like this movie because it fantasizes how two lives changed forever. High schoolers Mitsuha and
            Taki are complete strangers living separate lives.This bizarre occurrence 
            continues to happen randomly, and the two must adjust their lives around each other. 
            Yet, somehow, it works.I am amazed by the way how they build a connection and communicate 
            by leaving notes, messages, and more importantly, an imprint.
